# SAFE-control-too-2017
This is a College Project meant to implement the basic
aspects of Scrum Methodology and, as an add-on, learn C#, Visual Studio,
and ASP.Net.

We hope to have this finished by 2017/11/17.
Any and all pull requests from no members of the Scrum team will be denied due to 
restrictions given by our professor; however, any and all recomendations and
commentaries are always appreciated.

The project objective is to give assistance in keeping track of the tasks
given to your company employees regarding the computer risk.
This tasks will be given by an user who also will be able to see the progress of the
tasks being made. This project have to work for multiple companyes as well.
Currently the DB is in every computer of the Scrum Team, but will be descentralized eventually.

Thank you for taking the time to read :)
